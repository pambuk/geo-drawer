+please create a web application where I can provide geo points, and based on that a polygon will be drawn, it would also be good to have an option to provide a separate geo point, to check if it's inside or outside the drawn polygon

+this is cool but I'd like to provide points by entering them, not clicking on map, it doesn't have to be on a map, just a polygon  based on provided points

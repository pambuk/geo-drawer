# GEO-DRAWER PROJECT GUIDELINES

## Project Setup
- Open index.html in a browser to view the application
- No build tools required - pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Code Style Guidelines
- HTML: Semantic elements, BEM-style class naming
- CSS: Clean, modular styles with descriptive class names
- JavaScript: 
  - ES6+ syntax with const/let (no var)
  - Descriptive variable/function names in camelCase
  - Functions organized by responsibility
  - Error handling with try/catch blocks
  - JSDoc-style comments for functions

## Project Structure
- index.html: Main application HTML
- styles.css: Application styling
- script.js: Application logic and functionality

## Algorithms
- Point-in-polygon check uses ray-casting algorithm
- Geographic coordinate mapping uses linear transformation

## Feature Additions
When adding features:
1. Maintain the existing code structure
2. Follow the error handling pattern
3. Add appropriate documentation
4. Test with various polygon shapes and edge cases
